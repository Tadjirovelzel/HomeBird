The project NestWacht in collaboration with the TU Delft and other benefactors aims to design a sensor station in the form of a birdhouse that uses a camera and weather sensors to document bird activity and monitor properties of the local atmosphere such as humidity, pressure and particulate matter levels. 
This file serves to outline the structure and purpose of the folders contained within the project.
